--For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
--Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
--Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 


--Creating the table

CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
);

--Just to get overview of the table 
SELECT * 
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
LIMIT 5

--What is the top 5 artists based on popularity?
SELECT artist_name, popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity desc
LIMIT 5;

--What is the loudest song in the playlist and who was the artist?
SELECT track_name, loudness, artist_name
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata 
ORDER BY loudness desc
LIMIT 1;

--What is the average danceability by artist and track?
SELECT AVG(danceability), artist_name, track_name
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata;


--What is the average energy by artist and track?
SELECT AVG(energy), artist_name, track_name
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name, track_name;
